== Running

The explorer requires JRuby in version 9+ and Java8

If you are using `rvm` you can select it via

`rvm use jruby-9.1.5.0`

NOTE:: You need a version of Java8 later than 8u45. Also JRuby 9.1.5 is required at the moment (later
versions have an issue that prevents JRubyFX from running correctly).

install and use `bundler` to install the required gems

`gem install bundler`

`bundle install`

then run

`jruby -G -S hawkfx.rb # faster than bundle exec jruby hawkfx.rb`

=== Using SSL

There is a blog post on the Hawkular
blog http://www.hawkular.org/blog/2016/09/14/consuming-hawkular-api-over-ssl.html[that describes how to use SSL] in Hawkular and HawkFX.

=== Assumptions

Please make sure your JDK version is newer than `8u45`, basically with the latest hostpot JDK from Oracle you should be fine.
